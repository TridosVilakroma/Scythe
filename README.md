# Scythe
Rouge-like top down game, built with the pygame library.

You play as Scyman, a farmer trying to protect his farm as monsters start
appearing from within it.

You find special relics that have the power to change your form temporarily
into various animals.

At this point in development only an xbox controller is supported.
